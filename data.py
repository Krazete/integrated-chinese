''' TODO
- turn everything in 'data' directory to .json (instead of .js)
- make 'verify_lesson_and_write' verify by checking proper .json data file (instead of using a hardcoded lesson range)
- finish this file (load json so 'verify_lesson_and_write' can do its thing, then output only the relevant data to the html)
- put variable placeholders in html templates (to inject the relevant data to the html)
