# Extracting Data from the Original Website

The first iteration of this website used plain JavaScript to extract data from the original website. With XMLHttpRequest and a bunch of loops, I iterated through all of the original webpages and manually figured out patterns to help extract information. I did not note any of this down in comments or any other sort of documentation. Instead opted to simply store them in my memory. Two years later, I have forgotten.

This folder contains a new script to extract relevant information from the original website. It is written in Python instead of JavaScript mainly because it will consist of one main script to crawl the entire sitemap rather than a bunch of smaller, seemingly arbitrary scripts which crawl according to arbitrary URL patterns.

This reupholstery of the webscraping algorithm will be put on hold until the website content redesign is adequately complete. After all, it is more important to make the content available than it is to double-check that the content is correct and note down the differences. I do remember thoroughly double-checking the data two years ago too, which makes this webscraping revision even less important.
